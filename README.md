# Manager Web Application
* This is an ongoing project. Please do not use for any commercial purposes.
- This is a Manager Web Application, built in ASP.NET Core framework with C# as the main programming language for back end, HTML & CSS & Bootstrap CSS are used for front end, and JavaScript is used for both front end and back end (jQuery is used to take care of the call from front end to back end and vice-versa).
This web application is expected to have 4 different corners: Human Resouces, Payroll System, Product Management, and Discussion (Forum). Since these are 4 different purposes, the programming languages and frameworks used for this project are expected to be more than what is listed above.
(Thank you duc-master for the Payment Service API, which will help users to make payment online directly from the web app).
